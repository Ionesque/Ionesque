Hi, I’m @Ionesque

I’m interested in building the future of aircraft maintenance training! By focusing on aircraft avionics simulation 
& VR development I hope to build a brighter future. Currently I work Active Duty flightline aircraft maintenance, 
however I am currently looking to continue these efforts within the United States Air Force, I keep hearing the calls 
for innovation and I keep trying to answer. However, so far all attempts have gone unanswered.

I continue these efforts with a deep seated passion to make sure we leave a better environment behind for our 
future Airmen. I truly believe our training and readiness is what continues to give us our edge. If given the
chance I will do just that.

If you wish to contact me reach out to Infinity Spark Joint Base McGuire for my contact information.
