Hi, I’m @Ionesque

I’m interested in building the future of aircraft maintenance training! By focusing on aircraft avionics simulation 
& VR development I hope to build a brighter future. Currently I work aircraft avionics maintenance, with a deep seated passion for training the next generation. I am currently looking to continue these efforts within the United States Air Force, I hear the calls for innovation and modernization. Let's make it happen, and leave a better environment behind for our 
future Airmen. I truly believe our training and readiness is what continues to give us our edge. If given the
chance I will do just that.

If you wish to contact me reach out to Infinity Spark Joint Base McGuire, NJ for my contact information.
